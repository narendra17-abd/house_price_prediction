###House Price Prediction using XGBoost
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features like location, size, number of rooms, etc., 
using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm. 
XGBoost is chosen due to its superior performance compared to other algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees.

In this project, we leverage the XGBoost algorithm to predict house prices. XGBoost has been shown to deliver better performance 
than traditional machine learning algorithms, such as:

Linear Regression: Often too simplistic for complex datasets, leading to underfitting.
Random Forest: While powerful, it can be computationally expensive and may not capture relationships as effectively as XGBoost.
Decision Tree: Can overfit the data and may not generalize well to unseen data.

###Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), a common metric for regression tasks.
We compare the performance of XGBoost with that of other algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and 
Decision Trees, showing XGBoost's superior accuracy and speed in predicting house prices.
